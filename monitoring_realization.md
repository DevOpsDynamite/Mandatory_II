Monitoring Takeaways

We did not uncover major insights from our initial monitoring, primarily because our telemetry was limited to overall HTTP request counts and latency. A more comprehensive setup could have revealed additional issues.

However, we identified a steady rise in fetch attempts to our external weather API over several days. Investigation showed redundant periodic requests that fetched data without meaningful updates. We fixed this by implementing caching storing and refreshing data only when needed we significantly reduced API calls, improved response times, and enhanced application efficiency.

We also tracked the sum and count of request durations to calculate average latency. Even during traffic spikes, our average latency remained stable, confirming our server’s ability to handle increased load. Had we observed a significant rise in processing time, we would have pursued further performance tuning or scaling.

This experience shows the value of detailed monitoring especially in larger or production environments where uptime and early issue detection are critical. Increasing and diversifying telemetry can greatly improve our ability to detect and resolve performance issues effectively.
