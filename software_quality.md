### RuboCop

`rubocop` → 11 files, **34 offenses** (15 auto‑fixable).

* **Style/Layout** (long lines, gem order) – auto‑fix.
* **Naming / Rescue** – scheduled with next error‑handler review.
* **Metrics** – acceptable for now.

CI runs `rubocop -A && rubocop || true` so results are reported without breaking the build, maintaining software quality standards.

---

* **Agree?** Yes we agree fully with the findings.
* **Fixed?** Accessibility improvements (`alt` text, email input type) & many more
* **Ignored?** Missing documentation, assertion style issues (`refute`), unused variables, and minor RuboCop metric violations.
* **Why?** Issues ignored are cosmetic or low-priority, scheduled to be addressed naturally as the relevant parts of the codebase are revisited.

---

**TL;DR:** No critical issues; minor accessibility fixes implemented promptly. Remaining cosmetic findings scheduled for future improvements.
